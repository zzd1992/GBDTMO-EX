# GBDTMO-EX
This project provides examples for how to use [GBDT-MO](https://github.com/zzd1992/GBDTMO) and codes for reproduction the experiments in our preprint paper.

## How to use GBDT-MO
Suppose I have installed `gbdtmo`. If not, please refer [GBDT-MO](https://github.com/zzd1992/GBDTMO).

First, find the path of `gbdtmo.so` and modify `Lib_path` in `cfg.py`.
```python
Lib_path = "path to gbdtmo.so"
```
